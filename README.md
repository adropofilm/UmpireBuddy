The purpose of this project is to play around with Android programming. It serves as an introduction to semantics of Android/Java along with the mechanics of using Android Studio with the Android plugins.

The Android application functions as a ball-strike counter an umpire might use during a baseball game to keep track of the count for a batter.

The application keeps track of balls and strikes for a single batter, as well as total outs.

If the count reaches 3 strikes first, the application displays a dialog box announcing the batter is “Out!” If the count reaches 4 balls first, the application displays a dialog box announcing “Walk!” After either one, the count resets for the next batter.
